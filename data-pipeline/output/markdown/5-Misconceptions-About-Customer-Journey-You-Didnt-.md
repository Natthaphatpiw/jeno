# 5 Things You Might Misunderstand About Customer Journey

While many brands compete to deliver the best customer experience, few realize that understanding the customer journey isn’t just about designing seamless UX/UI or CRM systems. It’s about engaging with customers in a natural, deep, and multi-dimensional way that goes far beyond what you might expect.

Below are **5 common misconceptions about customer journey** that can derail even the best marketing strategies. Let’s see which ones you’ve encountered—or believed—yourself.

## What Is Customer Journey?

The customer journey refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand—from the first moment of awareness, through the purchase decision, and ideally into brand loyalty. It encompasses every touchpoint across both online and offline channels, including seeing an ad, browsing a website, trying a sample, or speaking with a customer service rep.

Understanding the customer journey is fundamental to modern marketing—especially as consumer behaviors grow more complex and diverse than ever before.

## 5 Misconceptions About Customer Journey You Might Not Know

### 1. The Simpler the Journey, the Better

Many brands mistakenly believe the customer journey should be as short and simple as possible to encourage quick decision-making. However, oversimplifying can backfire—especially when it removes critical information that helps customers feel confident.

For example, health-conscious consumers often need detailed product information, expert recommendations, and peer reviews. Stripping this down for simplicity could make their decision harder.

### 2. All Customers Follow the Same Journey

A common misconception is that everyone follows the same path. In reality, customers buying the same product may do so for different reasons. One might purchase quickly due to familiarity, while another may need extensive reviews or compare value and brand image.

Assuming a “one-size-fits-all” journey can cause your brand to miss opportunities to engage specific customer segments effectively.

### 3. Repeat Customers Want Everything to Stay the Same

Even with repeat purchases—like soap, toothpaste, or coffee—customers crave variety and freshness. Brands often assume consistency means avoiding change, but subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can add excitement and maintain engagement.

Consistency is key—but so is keeping things interesting to sustain long-term interest.

### 4. The Journey Ends at Purchase

Many marketers think the customer journey ends once a sale is made. On the contrary, this is often when the most important part begins. Exceptional post-purchase service can lead to repeat business, loyalty, and word-of-mouth referrals.

Extending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints is essential for increasing lifetime customer value.

### 5. One Journey Works for All Seasons

Using the same customer journey strategy year-round—without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts—can make your marketing feel out of touch. For instance, during economic downturns, customers may prioritize value over luxury, so focusing on premium branding may not resonate.

Customer journeys must evolve with real-time insights and context to stay relevant and impactful.

## Use the Customer Journey Matrix to Make Better Business Decisions

Many brands use a customer journey matrix, classifying journeys along two axes: complexity (easy–hard) and predictability (predictable–unpredictable). This results in four journey types:

- **Routine – Easy and Predictable**
  For everyday purchases like groceries or monthly services, predictable behavior allows for strategies like membership programs, [loyalty programs](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/transformation-and-technology/loyalty-program-tips), and auto-renewals.

- **Joyride – Easy but Unpredictable**
  Products driven by emotion or impulse—such as gifts or snacks—benefit from emotional marketing, fun content, and flash sales that tap into spur-of-the-moment decision-making.

- **Trek – Hard but Predictable**
  Big-ticket or long-term commitments like insurance, education, or real estate require planning. Recommended tactics include informative content, free consultations, and trial access.

- **Odyssey – Hard and Unpredictable**
  These journeys are typical of inspiration-based decisions, such as social impact startups or creative ventures. Successful strategies include brand storytelling, purpose-driven messaging, and community building.

By understanding these differences, brands can see that designing a customer journey isn’t about making everything easy—it’s about matching strategies to the journey type for better engagement and results.
