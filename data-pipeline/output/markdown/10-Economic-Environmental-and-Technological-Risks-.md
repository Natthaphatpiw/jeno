## 10 Global Risk Factors in 2025 That Organizations Must Prepare For

### Economic Risks

#### 1. Geopolitical Conflicts and Tensions
Political conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties are major risk factors affecting the global economy. Tensions between major powers such as the United States, China, and Russia could lead to economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and disruptions in global supply chains. Conflicts in the Middle East and Asia may impact energy prices and financial market stability.

Organizations relying on international markets must diversify resources and business partners while monitoring trade policies and protectionist measures.

#### 2. Economic Crises and Financial Instability
Despite recovery from COVID-19 impacts, the global economy remains fragile. Economic slowdowns in major markets like the U.S. and Europe could affect industries widely. Rising interest rates and high public debt create financial uncertainties.

Businesses should track economic indicators and develop strategies such as investment diversification and cash flow management.

#### 3. Health Crises and Pandemics
The risk of new disease outbreaks remains significant due to virus mutations, vaccine hesitancy, and healthcare limitations. Businesses dependent on stable workforces and supply chains should adopt flexible work arrangements and enhance health and safety measures.

#### 4. Labor Shortages and Economic Inequality
Declining birth rates and workforce shifts cause labor shortages. Automation and AI replace some jobs, risking unemployment for low-skilled workers.

Organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling while promoting economic equality and access to opportunities.

#### 5. Shortages of Strategic Resources
Supply shortages of semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and clean energy resources arise from geopolitical and environmental factors. Trade uncertainties and conflicts may disrupt supply chains and increase costs.

Businesses should explore alternative sources, develop recycling technologies, and boost domestic production to reduce import reliance.

### Environmental & Social Risks

#### 6. Environmental Disasters and Climate Change
Natural disasters like floods, storms, and heatwaves increasingly impact industries through higher costs, supply chain disruptions, and infrastructure damage.

Climate change drives regulatory shifts pushing cleaner energy adoption and carbon reduction. Businesses must integrate sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and optimize resource efficiency. ESG compliance pressures from governments, investors, and consumers are reshaping corporate priorities.

#### 7. Erosion of Human Rights and Civil Liberties
Increasing control over information, media restrictions, and tightened civil freedoms pose risks to businesses. Policies limiting information access, strict data regulations, and freedom of expression restrictions affect transparency and trade.

Human rights concerns such as forced labor, surveillance, and privacy violations can damage reputation and cause legal issues.

Companies must enforce human rights policies, conduct supply chain due diligence, and ensure ethical compliance to maintain stability and trust.

### Technological Risks

#### 8. Social Divisions and Misinformation
Misinformation and fake news impact society and business, especially via social media. False information harms brand reputation and sparks social conflicts.

Businesses should implement data governance, use AI and machine learning to detect false information, and enhance communication transparency.

#### 9. Technology and Cyber Threats
Advancements in AI, [Blockchain](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/transformation-and-technology/what-is-blockchain), and [Quantum Computing](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/futurist/what-is-quantum-computing) offer opportunities but increase cybersecurity risks such as ransomware attacks.
