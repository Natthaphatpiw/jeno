# What Is Low-Code/No-Code? Build Apps Without Writing Code!

In todayâ€™s digital age, rapid application development is crucial for organizational competitiveness. Low code and no code platforms are gaining popularity worldwide, helping SMEs, retail businesses, and government agencies improve services efficiently.

## What Is Low Code?

Low code platforms enable users to develop applications with minimal or no coding, using drag-and-drop tools for workflows, databases, and user interfaces. They balance ease of use with customization, allowing developers to extend applications as needed. This suits organizations needing flexibility with some developer resources.

## What Is a No Code Platform?

No code platforms allow users to build applications without writing any code. Designed for non-technical staff like marketing or operations teams, they use pre-built templates and ready-to-use features. This reduces IT workload and promotes citizen developers, enabling broader participation in digital transformation.
