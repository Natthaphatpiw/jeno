Liang's goal is to develop technology that can transform the way AI systems operate in the future. With a clear vision to create AI capable of processing data efficiently while reducing operational costs, DeepSeek AI has quickly gained attention from investors and users globally as a promising new AI from China.

## What Makes DeepSeek AI Stand Out from Other Chatbots on the Market?

DeepSeek AI is not only highly efficient but also boasts several features that differentiate it from other models. These features help reduce development and operational costs and significantly enhance data processing efficiency. Key highlights include:

### Use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) Technology

DeepSeek AI uses Mixture of Experts (MoE) technology, which improves AI performance by selecting the most suitable expert for each task, reducing costs and increasing processing speed compared to single-model AI.

### Collaboration with AMD

DeepSeek has partnered with AMD to utilize Instinct GPUs and ROCM (Radeon Open Compute) software, which are not subject to U.S. export restrictions. This enables faster, more efficient data processing without concerns about U.S. government restrictions.

### DeepSeek Coder – A Free Coding Tool

DeepSeek Coder is a free, open-source tool that allows users to write code more easily and efficiently, promoting global collaboration and innovation.

### DeepSeek LLM (Large Language Model)

## How Much Does DeepSeek AI Cost?

DeepSeek AI is cost-effective, offering much lower prices than competitors like OpenAI.

- DeepSeek R1 pricing:
  - $0.55 per 1 million input tokens
  - $2.19 per 1 million output tokens
