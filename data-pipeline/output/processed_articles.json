      "content": "# Get to Know DeepSeek AI: The Trending Chatbot App from China When it comes to [artificial intelligence (AI)]( the names that often come to mind are big companies from the West, such as OpenAI or Google. However, Asia is also making significant strides in technology. Recently, a startup from China is shaking up the AI industry with innovative solutions at an affordable price. That startup is **\"DeepSeek AI,\"** which is quickly becoming a symbol of limitless potential and capabilities in an era where China faces challenges from trade sanctions. ## What is DeepSeek AI? DeepSeek is a small startup based in Hangzhou, China, founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese businessman and expert in hedge funds and AI. Liang's goal is to develop technology that can transform how AI systems operate in the future. With a vision to create AI capable of processing data efficiently while reducing operational costs, DeepSeek AI has quickly gained attention from investors and users globally as a promising new AI from China. ## What Makes DeepSeek AI Stand Out from Other Chatbots on the Market? DeepSeek AI is not only highly efficient but also boasts features that differentiate it from other models. These features reduce development and operational costs and enhance data processing efficiency. Key highlights include: ### Use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) Technology DeepSeek AI uses Mixture of Experts (MoE) technology, which improves AI performance by selecting the most suitable expert for each task, reducing costs and increasing processing speed compared to single-model AI. ### Collaboration with AMD DeepSeek partners with AMD to utilize Instinct GPUs and ROCM (Radeon Open Compute) software, which are not subject to U. This enables faster, more efficient data processing without concerns about U. government restrictions. ### DeepSeek Coder – A Free Coding Tool DeepSeek Coder is a free, open-source tool that helps users write code more easily and efficiently, promoting global collaboration and innovation. ### DeepSeek LLM (Large Language Model) DeepSeek LLM is a large language model capable of natural human-like communication, enhancing the system's ability to understand and respond accurately to user queries. ### DeepSeek R1 – A High-Performance AI Model DeepSeek R1 operates at one-tenth the cost of ChatGPT, processing data quickly and accurately while being cost-effective. It supports various applications, from chatbots to business integrations. ## How Much Does DeepSeek AI Cost? DeepSeek AI is cost-effective, offering much lower prices compared to other AI services like OpenAI. - DeepSeek R1 pricing: - $0. 55 per 1 million input tokens - $2. 19 per 1 million output tokens - OpenAI pricing: - $15 per 1 million input tokens - $60 per 1 million output tokens This significant price difference makes DeepSeek AI attractive for businesses aiming to reduce AI development and operational costs. Additionally, DeepSeek offers some features for free, allowing users to explore its technology without financial commitments. ## Limitations of DeepSeek AI While DeepSeek AI offers high efficiency at a lower cost, some limitations could affect its adoption and growth: ### Data Security Challenges Data security is a major concern, especially when handling personal or confidential data. DeepSeek may not fully guarantee data security in all aspects. Addressing risks related to data breaches or misuse remains a challenge to build greater user trust. ### Preventing AI Misuse AI technology can generate accurate and fast content but can be dangerous if misused, such as creating fake news or manipulated information that deceives people or causes societal harm.",

That startup is **\"DeepSeek AI,\"** which is quickly becoming a symbol of limitless potential and capabilities in an era where China faces challenges from trade sanctions.\n\n## What is DeepSeek AI?\n\nDeepSeek is a small startup based in Hangzhou, China, founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese businessman and expert in hedge funds and AI. Liang's goal is to develop technology that can transform how AI systems operate in the future. With a vision to create AI capable of processing data efficiently while reducing operational costs, DeepSeek AI has quickly gained attention from investors and users globally as a promising new AI from China.\n\n## What Makes DeepSeek AI Stand Out from Other Chatbots on the Market?\n\nDeepSeek AI is not only highly efficient but also boasts features that differentiate it from other models. These features reduce development and operational costs and enhance data processing efficiency. Key highlights include:\n\n### Use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) Technology\n\nDeepSeek AI uses Mixture of Experts (MoE) technology, which improves AI performance by selecting the most suitable expert for each task, reducing costs and increasing processing speed compared to single-model AI.\n\n### Collaboration with AMD\n\nDeepSeek partners with AMD to utilize Instinct GPUs and ROCM (Radeon Open Compute) software, which are not subject to U.S. export restrictions. This enables faster, more efficient data processing without concerns about U.S. government restrictions.\n\n### DeepSeek Coder – A Free Coding Tool\n\nDeepSeek Coder is a free, open-source tool that helps users write code more easily and efficiently, promoting global collaboration and innovation.\n\n### DeepSeek LLM (Large Language Model)\n\nDeepSeek LLM is a large language model capable of natural human-like communication, enhancing the system's ability to understand and respond accurately to user queries.\n\n### DeepSeek R1 – A High-Performance AI Model\n\nDeepSeek R1 operates at one-tenth the cost of ChatGPT, processing data quickly and accurately while being cost-effective. It supports various applications, from chatbots to business integrations.\n\n## How Much Does DeepSeek AI Cost?\n\nDeepSeek AI is cost-effective, offering much lower prices compared to other AI services like OpenAI.\n\n- DeepSeek R1 pricing:\n  - $0.55 per 1 million input tokens\n  - $2.19 per 1 million output tokens\n\n- OpenAI pricing:\n  - $15 per 1 million input tokens\n  - $60 per 1 million output tokens\n\nThis significant price difference makes DeepSeek AI attractive for businesses aiming to reduce AI development and operational costs. Additionally, DeepSeek offers some features for free, allowing users to explore its technology without financial commitments.\n\n## Limitations of DeepSeek AI\n\nWhile DeepSeek AI offers high efficiency at a lower cost, some limitations could affect its adoption and growth:\n\n### Data Security Challenges\n\nData security is a major concern, especially when handling personal or confidential data. DeepSeek may not fully guarantee data security in all aspects. Addressing risks related to data breaches or misuse remains a challenge to build greater user trust.\n\n### Preventing AI Misuse\n\nAI technology can generate accurate and fast content but can be dangerous if misused, such as creating fake news or manipulated information that deceives people or causes societal harm.\n",

A 2025’s Breakthrough Technology In an era of rapidly advancing technology, one of the innovations gaining significant attention is **\"Quantum Computing. \"** This cutting-edge [technology]( holds the potential to transform our world profoundly, especially as we approach 2025. This article will guide you in understanding what quantum computing is, how it works, and how it could impact our world! ## What is Quantum Computing? Quantum computing is a computational technology that uses quantum physics principles to process information, unlike traditional computers that rely on electronic principles. While traditional computers use bits (0 or 1) to process data, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in states of 0, 1, or both simultaneously. By leveraging quantum physics, quantum computers can process vast amounts of data at once, making their computing speed significantly faster than traditional computers, especially for solving certain complex problems. ## How Does Quantum Computing Work? Quantum computing operates based on three key principles: ### Superposition Superposition enables qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike traditional computer bits that must be either 0 or 1. This property allows quantum computing to process large amounts of information at once, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. ### Quantum Entanglement Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become tightly correlated, even across great distances. Changing the state of one entangled qubit immediately affects the other, enabling quantum computing to transfer and process information more swiftly and efficiently. ### Quantum Interference Quantum interference allows quantum computing to select the correct answer from all possible outcomes. This is done by amplifying the probability waves of the correct answers while canceling out those of incorrect answers, leading to accurate and rapid solutions. ## The Impact of Quantum Computing on the World in 2025 Quantum computing has the potential to transform various industries by 2025, including: ### Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Quantum computing will accelerate new drug discovery by simulating molecular reactions with precision, allowing faster testing of drug efficacy. It can also analyze extensive genetic data to develop highly effective personalized medicine. ### Finance and Banking In finance, quantum computing will revolutionize risk analysis and portfolio optimization, creating more effective investment strategies. It will also enhance the security of financial transactions through quantum encryption systems that are more secure than current methods. ### Transportation and Logistics Quantum computing will improve complex routing problems, enabling the design of time- and energy-efficient transport routes. It will also aid in warehouse management and demand forecasting with high accuracy. ### Supply Chain Management Quantum computing’s ability to process large datasets will make supply chain management more efficient, allowing for quick problem prediction and adaptation, reducing costs and enhancing operational flexibility. ### Weather Forecasting and Climate Change Quantum computing will enhance climate simulation accuracy, enabling earlier natural disaster predictions and effective planning. Additionally, it will aid in studying long-term climate change impacts with great detail. ### Automotive Industry In the automotive sector, quantum computing will help develop more efficient batteries for electric vehicles by simulating complex chemical reactions. It will also support the design of strong, lightweight vehicle structures and advance safe autonomous driving systems. ### Energy and Environment Quantum computing will play a critical role in advancing clean energy technologies, such as improving solar cell efficiency, developing biofuel synthesis processes, and designing materials that absorb carbon dioxide. It will also optimize natural resource management and energy planning efficiently. ## Challenges and Limitations of Quantum Computing ### Qubit Instability Qubits are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as heat, vibrations, or magnetic fields, which can lead to calculation errors. Developing Quantum Error Correction systems is crucial, and researchers are actively working on this to improve stability. ### Requirement for Extremely Low Temperatures Quantum computers need to operate at extremely low temperatures, near absolute zero (-273. 15°C), to maintain the quantum state of qubits. This requirement leads to high operational and maintenance costs. ### Continuous Development of New Algorithms and Software Developing algorithms and software compatible with quantum computing is a significant challenge. The programming and problem-solving approaches for quantum computers are vastly different from traditional computers. Developers need to learn and adapt to new concepts, such as utilizing superposition and entanglement, to solve problems effectively.",

A 2025’s Breakthrough Technology In an era of rapidly advancing technology, one of the innovations gaining significant attention is **\"Quantum Computing. \"** This cutting-edge [technology]( holds the potential to transform our world profoundly, especially as we approach 2025. This article will guide you in understanding what quantum computing is, how it works, and how it could impact our world! #### What is Quantum Computing? Quantum computing is a computational technology that uses quantum physics principles to process information, unlike traditional computers that rely on electronic principles. While traditional computers use bits (0 or 1) to process data, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in states of 0, 1, or both simultaneously. By leveraging quantum physics, quantum computers can process vast amounts of data at once, making their computing speed significantly faster than traditional computers, especially for solving certain complex problems. #### How Does Quantum Computing Work? Quantum computing operates based on three key principles: ##### Superposition Superposition enables qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike traditional computer bits that must be either 0 or 1. This property allows quantum computing to process large amounts of information at once, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. ##### Quantum Entanglement Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become tightly correlated, even across great distances. Changing the state of one entangled qubit immediately affects the other, enabling quantum computing to transfer and process information more swiftly and efficiently. ##### Quantum Interference Quantum interference allows quantum computing to select the correct answer from all possible outcomes. This is done by amplifying the probability waves of the correct answers while canceling out those of incorrect answers, leading to accurate and rapid solutions. #### The Impact of Quantum Computing on the World in 2025 Quantum computing has the potential to transform various industries by 2025, including: - **Medicine and Pharmaceuticals:** Accelerates drug discovery by simulating molecular reactions with precision and analyzes extensive genetic data for personalized medicine. - **Finance and Banking:** Revolutionizes risk analysis and portfolio optimization, enhances security through quantum encryption. - **Transportation and Logistics:** Improves complex routing problems, warehouse management, and demand forecasting. - **Supply Chain Management:** Processes large datasets for efficient problem prediction and adaptation, reducing costs. - **Weather Forecasting and Climate Change:** Enhances climate simulation accuracy for earlier disaster predictions and detailed climate impact studies. - **Automotive Industry:** Develops efficient batteries for electric vehicles, designs lightweight structures, and advances autonomous driving systems. - **Energy and Environment:** Advances clean energy technologies, optimizes resource management and energy planning. #### Challenges and Limitations of Quantum Computing ##### Qubit Instability Qubits are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as heat, vibrations, or magnetic fields, which can lead to calculation errors.

It can also be tailored to align with the specific coding standards of each organization, making CriticGPT an invaluable tool for developing high-quality and reliable software.\n\n## What are the Benefits of CriticGPT?\n\n### Reduces Code Review Time\n\n- Analyzes large volumes of code quickly\n- Accurately identifies hidden issues\n- Saves time on manual code reviews\n- Inspects adherence to style guides, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks\n\n### Enhances Software Security\n\n- Identifies potential security vulnerabilities before deployment\n- Helps comply with security standards like OWASP Top 10\n- Reduces risk of cyber-attacks\n\n### Improves Performance\n\n- Offers recommendations on code optimization and appropriate functions\n- Detects and fixes issues early, reducing bugs and troubleshooting costs\n\n### Minimizes Errors\n\n- Detects syntax and logical errors accurately\n- Provides immediate suggestions for correction\n\n## Limitations of CriticGPT That Should Be Aware Of\n\n### Limited Ability to Provide Long Explanations\n\nCriticGPT often gives concise answers, which can make it challenging to fully understand root causes and fixes, especially for complex code.\n\n### Cannot Fully Replace Humans or Eliminate Errors Completely\n\nWhile it reduces errors, CriticGPT cannot identify or fix all mistakes, particularly complex or novel ones. Developers must remain actively involved.\n\n### Concise Responses May Lead to Incomplete Error Identification\n\nBrief responses may overlook hidden errors or context-related issues.\n\n### Difficulty Analyzing Highly Complex Work\n\nMay struggle with very complex, domain-specific, or less common programming languages requiring specialized knowledge.\n\nNonetheless, CriticGPT is a powerful tool to help developers review and improve ChatGPT-generated code. It enhances software development efficiency but should be used to complement, not replace, developer expertise.\n\n> Developers should combine CriticGPT with their own knowledge and experience to create high-quality software that truly meets users' needs.\n",

      "content": "# 5 Things You Might Misunderstand About Customer Journey While many brands compete to deliver the best customer experience, few realize that understanding the customer journey isn’t just about designing seamless UX/UI or CRM systems. It’s about engaging with customers in a natural, deep, and multi-dimensional way that goes far beyond expectations. Below are **5 common misconceptions about customer journey** that can derail even the best marketing strategies. Let’s see which ones you’ve encountered—or believed—yourself. ## What Is Customer Journey? The customer journey refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand—from the first moment of awareness, through the purchase decision, and ideally into brand loyalty. It encompasses every touchpoint across both online and offline channels, including seeing an ad, browsing a website, trying a sample, or speaking with a customer service rep. Understanding the customer journey is fundamental to modern marketing—especially as consumer behaviors grow more complex and diverse than ever before. ## 5 Misconceptions About Customer Journey You Might Not Know ### 1. The Simpler the Journey, the Better Many brands mistakenly believe the customer journey should be as short and simple as possible to encourage quick decisions. However, oversimplifying can backfire—especially when it removes critical information that helps customers feel confident. For example, health-conscious consumers often need detailed product information, expert recommendations, and peer reviews. Stripping this down for simplicity could make their decision harder. All Customers Follow the Same Journey A common misconception is that everyone follows the same path. In reality, customers buying the same product may do so for different reasons. One might purchase quickly due to familiarity, while another may need extensive reviews or compare value and brand image. Assuming a “one-size-fits-all” journey can cause your brand to miss opportunities to engage specific customer segments effectively. Repeat Customers Want Everything to Stay the Same Even with repeat purchases—like soap, toothpaste, or coffee—customers crave variety and freshness. Brands often assume consistency means avoiding change, but subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can add excitement and maintain engagement. Consistency is key—but so is keeping things interesting to sustain long-term interest. The Journey Ends at Purchase Many marketers think the customer journey ends once a sale is made. On the contrary, this is often when the most important part begins. Exceptional post-purchase service can lead to repeat business, loyalty, and word-of-mouth referrals. Extending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints is essential for increasing lifetime customer value. One Journey Works for All Seasons Using the same customer journey strategy year-round—without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts—can make your marketing feel out of touch. For instance, during economic downturns, customers may prioritize value over luxury, so focusing on premium branding may not resonate. Customer journeys must evolve with real-time insights and context to stay relevant and impactful. ## Use the Customer Journey Matrix to Make Better Business Decisions Many brands now use a customer journey matrix, which classifies journeys along two key axes: complexity (easy–hard) and predictability (predictable–unpredictable). This results in four journey types: - **Routine – Easy and Predictable** For everyday purchases like groceries or monthly services, predictable behavior allows for strategies like membership programs, [loyalty programs]( and auto-renewals. - **Joyride – Easy but Unpredictable** Products driven by emotion or impulse—such as gifts or snacks—benefit from emotional marketing, fun content, and flash sales that tap into spur-of-the-moment decision-making. - **Trek – Hard but Predictable** Big-ticket or long-term commitments like insurance, education, or real estate require planning. Recommended tactics include informative content, free consultations, and trial access. - **Odyssey – Hard and Unpredictable** These journeys are typical of inspiration-based decisions, such as social impact startups or creative ventures. Successful strategies include brand storytelling, purpose-driven messaging, and community building. By understanding these differences, brands can see that designing a customer journey isn’t about making everything easy—it’s about tailoring strategies to fit the journey’s nature and customer needs.",

It’s about engaging with customers in a natural, deep, and multi-dimensional way that goes far beyond expectations. Below are **5 common misconceptions about customer journey** that can derail even the best marketing strategies. ## What Is Customer Journey? The customer journey refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand—from the first moment of awareness, through the purchase decision, and ideally into brand loyalty. It includes every touchpoint across online and offline channels, such as seeing an ad, browsing a website, trying a sample, or speaking with customer service. Understanding the customer journey is fundamental to modern marketing, especially as consumer behaviors grow more complex and diverse. ## 5 Misconceptions About Customer Journey You Might Not Know ### 1. The Simpler the Journey, the Better Many brands believe the journey should be as short and simple as possible to encourage quick decisions. However, oversimplifying can backfire by removing critical information that helps customers feel confident. For example, health-conscious consumers often need detailed product info, expert recommendations, and peer reviews. All Customers Follow the Same Journey Assuming everyone follows the same path is a common misconception. Customers may buy the same product for different reasons—some quickly due to familiarity, others after extensive research. A one-size-fits-all approach can miss opportunities to engage specific segments effectively. Repeat Customers Want Everything to Stay the Same Even repeat buyers crave variety and freshness. While consistency is key, subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can maintain excitement and long-term engagement. The Journey Ends at Purchase The journey often begins after the sale. Exceptional post-purchase service leads to repeat business, loyalty, and referrals. Extending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints increases lifetime customer value. One Journey Works for All Seasons Using the same strategy year-round without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts can make marketing feel out of touch. Customer journeys must evolve with real-time insights to stay relevant. ## Use the Customer Journey Matrix to Make Better Business Decisions Many brands use a customer journey matrix classifying journeys by complexity (easy–hard) and predictability (predictable–unpredictable), resulting in four journey types: - **Routine – Easy and Predictable**: Everyday purchases like groceries benefit from loyalty programs and auto-renewals. - **Joyride – Easy but Unpredictable**: Impulse products like gifts benefit from emotional marketing and flash sales. - **Trek – Hard but Predictable**: Big commitments like insurance require informative content and consultations. - **Odyssey – Hard and Unpredictable**: Inspiration-based decisions like social impact ventures benefit from storytelling and community building. By understanding these differences, brands see that designing a customer journey isn’t about making everything easy but about tailoring strategies to fit the journey type and customer needs.",

All Customers Follow the Same Journey A common misconception is that everyone follows the same path. In reality, customers buying the same product may do so for different reasons—some purchase quickly due to familiarity, others need extensive reviews or comparisons. Assuming a “one-size-fits-all” journey can cause brands to miss opportunities to engage specific segments effectively. Repeat Customers Want Everything to Stay the Same Even repeat purchases like soap or coffee crave variety and freshness. Brands often assume consistency means no change, but subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can add excitement and maintain engagement. Consistency is key—but so is keeping things interesting for long-term interest. The Journey Ends at Purchase Many marketers think the journey ends once a sale is made. On the contrary, this is often when the most important part begins. Exceptional post-purchase service can lead to repeat business, loyalty, and referrals. Extending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints is essential for increasing lifetime customer value. One Journey Works for All Seasons Using the same journey strategy year-round—without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts—can make marketing feel out of touch. For example, during economic downturns, customers may prioritize value over luxury.

Routine – Easy and Predictable For everyday purchases like groceries or monthly services, predictable behavior allows strategies like membership programs, [loyalty programs]( and auto-renewals. Joyride – Easy but Unpredictable Products driven by emotion or impulse—such as gifts or snacks—benefit from emotional marketing, fun content, and flash sales that tap into spur-of-the-moment decisions. Trek – Hard but Predictable Big-ticket or long-term commitments like insurance, education, or real estate require planning. Recommended tactics include informative content, free consultations, and trial access. Odyssey – Hard and Unpredictable These journeys are typical of inspiration-based decisions, such as social impact startups or creative ventures. Successful strategies include brand storytelling, purpose-driven messaging, and community building. By understanding these differences, brands can see that designing a customer journey isn’t about making everything easy—it’s about matching strategies to journey types for better engagement and results.",

        "5_things_you_might_misunderstand_about_customer_jo": "While many brands compete to deliver the best customer experience, few realize that understanding the customer journey isn’t just about designing seamless UX/UI or CRM systems. It’s about engaging with customers in a natural, deep, and multi-dimensional way that goes far beyond expectations.\nBelow are **5 common misconceptions about customer journey** that can derail even the best marketing strategies. Let’s see which ones you’ve encountered—or believed—yourself.",
        "what_is_customer_journey?": "The customer journey refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand—from the first moment of awareness, through the purchase decision, and ideally into brand loyalty. It encompasses every touchpoint across both online and offline channels, including seeing an ad, browsing a website, trying a sample, or speaking with customer service.\nUnderstanding the customer journey is fundamental to modern marketing—especially as consumer behaviors grow more complex and diverse.",
        "1._the_simpler_the_journey,_the_better": "Many brands mistakenly believe the journey should be as short and simple as possible to encourage quick decisions. However, oversimplifying can backfire by removing critical information that helps customers feel confident.\nFor example, health-conscious consumers often need detailed product info, expert recommendations, and peer reviews. Stripping these down for simplicity can make decisions harder.",
        "2._all_customers_follow_the_same_journey": "A common misconception is that everyone follows the same path. In reality, customers buying the same product may do so for different reasons—some purchase quickly due to familiarity, others need extensive reviews or comparisons.\nAssuming a “one-size-fits-all” journey can cause brands to miss opportunities to engage specific segments effectively.",
        "3._repeat_customers_want_everything_to_stay_the_sa": "Even repeat purchases like soap or coffee crave variety and freshness. Brands often assume consistency means no change, but subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can add excitement and maintain engagement.\nConsistency is key—but so is keeping things interesting for long-term interest.",
        "4._the_journey_ends_at_purchase": "Many marketers think the journey ends once a sale is made. On the contrary, this is often when the most important part begins. Exceptional post-purchase service can lead to repeat business, loyalty, and referrals.\nExtending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints is essential for increasing lifetime customer value.",
        "5._one_journey_works_for_all_seasons": "Using the same journey strategy year-round—without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts—can make marketing feel out of touch. For example, during economic downturns, customers may prioritize value over luxury.\nCustomer journeys must evolve with real-time insights and context to stay relevant.",
        "use_the_customer_journey_matrix_to_make_better_bus": "Many brands use a customer journey matrix classifying journeys along two axes: complexity (easy–hard) and predictability (predictable–unpredictable), resulting in four journey types:",
        "1._routine_–_easy_and_predictable": "For everyday purchases like groceries or monthly services, predictable behavior allows strategies like membership programs, [loyalty programs](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/transformation-and-technology/loyalty-program-tips), and auto-renewals.",
        "2._joyride_–_easy_but_unpredictable": "Products driven by emotion or impulse—such as gifts or snacks—benefit from emotional marketing, fun content, and flash sales that tap into spur-of-the-moment decisions.",
        "3._trek_–_hard_but_predictable": "Big-ticket or long-term commitments like insurance, education, or real estate require planning. Recommended tactics include informative content, free consultations, and trial access.",
        "4._odyssey_–_hard_and_unpredictable": "These journeys are typical of inspiration-based decisions, such as social impact startups or creative ventures. Successful strategies include brand storytelling, purpose-driven messaging, and community building.\nBy understanding these differences, brands can see that designing a customer journey isn’t about making everything easy—it’s about matching strategies to journey types for better engagement and results."

In their world, there is no boundary between reality and imagination, no framework for \"impossible\" or \"too difficult. \" Everything is an opportunity, and every limitation is a canvas for their creativity. They are the new generation who not only push beyond limits but redefine what \"limits\" mean altogether. Let's dive into the world of Gen Beta. Who are they? How are they different from previous generations? And why should you start understanding them today? Because this generation isn’t just stepping into the future—they are the ones creating it! ## What is Gen Beta? Who are They? **Gen Beta refers to individuals born from 2025 onwards. ** They are the first generation to grow up in a truly digital world, living in an era where technology is seamlessly integrated into daily life. Unlike previous generations who had to adapt to technological changes, Generation Beta will naturally coexist with technology as if it were second nature. What sets Gen Beta apart is their unique bond with technology—it will be as intrinsic to them as breathing. ## What Will Generation Beta be Like? ### Advanced Creativity Gen Beta possesses boundless creativity, seamlessly blending technology with innovation in extraordinary ways. Their problem-solving methods go far beyond traditional approaches, embracing out-of-the-box thinking that previous generations might not have imagined. ### Expertise in Technology For Generation Beta, technology isn’t just a tool—it’s their primary language for engaging with the world. They have an innate understanding of advanced technologies such as [artificial intelligence (AI)]( data analytics, and cutting-edge innovations, often requiring minimal effort to learn and adapt. ### Data-Driven Decision-Making While Gen X and Gen Y tend to rely on personal experiences and advice from elders, and Gen Z draws insights from social media and online opinions, Gen Beta takes it a step further. They base their decisions primarily on data and analytics. With exceptional skills in processing complex information, they can quickly grasp the big picture and make informed choices. ### Emphasis on Ethics and Sustainability Gen Beta places significant value on sustainability and ethics. They are deeply committed to driving positive change in society and the environment, striving for tangible improvements that reflect their values. ## Generation Beta Marketing Solutions ### Create Content That Resonates and Reflects Their Identity Content aimed at Gen Beta must be thoughtful and meaningful. It should go beyond simply providing information to challenge traditional mindsets and encourage critical thinking. This generation values intellectual depth, diverse perspectives, and systematic connections between ideas. To build credibility, marketers should rely on insights from research and ensure transparency in data sources. Gen Beta prefers to verify and analyze information themselves, making transparency a crucial factor in gaining their trust. ### Use Technology to Foster Connection To align with Generation Beta marketing solutions, businesses must innovate their communication strategies to provide seamless, personalized experiences. This includes leveraging platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or real-time customer interaction systems capable of understanding both context and emotions for smoother and more meaningful connections. ### Highlight Transparency and Sustainability Across Business Dimensions As socially conscious individuals, Gen Beta demands tangible evidence of efforts to create a positive impact. Examples include detailed disclosures of production processes, demonstrations of social and environmental contributions, and clear sustainability metrics. These efforts significantly enhance trust and loyalty among this generation. ### Foster a Sense of Participation For Generation Beta, engagement goes beyond listening—it’s about co-creating products and services with brands. Businesses should focus on fostering innovation spaces where Gen Beta can contribute their creative ideas. This could involve platforms for brainstorming, opportunities to participate in product development, or rewards for innovative ideas. For anyone who still sees Gen Z or Gen Alpha as the most noteworthy groups of this era, it’s time to rethink—Gen Beta is emerging and will surpass them in influence by leaps and bounds. The world they are growing up in isn’t just equipped with advanced tools; it’s a world they are designing themselves, from the economy to culture. This is an era where human creativity and limitless potential will be harnessed to drive real change. Generation Beta is not merely the \"future\"; they are the force that will push us beyond the boundaries of imagination.",

In their world, there is no boundary between reality and imagination, no framework for \"impossible\" or \"too difficult. \" Everything is an opportunity, and every limitation is a canvas for their creativity. They are the new generation who not only push beyond limits but redefine what \"limits\" mean altogether. Let's dive into the world of Gen Beta. Who are they? How are they different from previous generations? And why should you start understanding them today? Because this generation isn’t just stepping into the future—they are the ones creating it! ## What is Gen Beta? Who are They? **Gen Beta refers to individuals born from 2025 onwards. ** They are the first generation to grow up in a truly digital world, living in an era where technology is seamlessly integrated into daily life. Unlike previous generations who had to adapt to technological changes, Generation Beta will naturally coexist with technology as if it were second nature. What sets Gen Beta apart is their unique bond with technology—it will be as intrinsic to them as anything else. ## What Will Generation Beta be Like? ### Advanced Creativity Gen Beta possesses boundless creativity, seamlessly blending technology with innovation in extraordinary ways. Their problem-solving methods go far beyond traditional approaches, embracing out-of-the-box thinking that previous generations might not have imagined. ### Expertise in Technology For Generation Beta, technology isn’t just a tool—it’s their primary language for engaging with the world. They have an innate understanding of advanced technologies such as [artificial intelligence (AI)]( data analytics, and cutting-edge innovations, often requiring minimal effort to learn and adapt. ### Data-Driven Decision-Making While Gen X and Gen Y tend to rely on personal experiences and advice from elders, and Gen Z draws insights from social media and online opinions, Gen Beta takes it a step further. They base their decisions primarily on data and analytics. With exceptional skills in processing complex information, they can quickly grasp the big picture and make informed choices. ### Emphasis on Ethics and Sustainability Gen Beta places significant value on sustainability and ethics. They are deeply committed to driving positive change in society and the environment, striving for tangible improvements that reflect their values. ## Generation Beta Marketing Solutions ### Create Content That Resonates and Reflects Their Identity Content aimed at Gen Beta must be thoughtful and meaningful. It should go beyond simply providing information to challenge traditional mindsets and encourage critical thinking. This generation values intellectual depth, diverse perspectives, and systematic connections between ideas. To build credibility, marketers should rely on insights from research and ensure transparency in data sources. Gen Beta prefers to verify and analyze information themselves, making transparency a crucial factor in gaining their trust. ### Use Technology to Foster Connection To align with Generation Beta marketing solutions, businesses must innovate their communication strategies to provide seamless, personalized experiences. This includes leveraging platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or real-time customer interaction systems capable of understanding both context and emotions for smoother and more meaningful connections. ### Highlight Transparency and Sustainability Across Business Dimensions As socially conscious individuals, Gen Beta demands tangible evidence of efforts to create a positive impact. Examples include detailed disclosures of production processes, demonstrations of social and environmental contributions, and clear sustainability metrics. These efforts significantly enhance trust and loyalty among this generation. ### Foster a Sense of Participation For Generation Beta, engagement goes beyond listening—it’s about co-creating products and services with brands. Businesses should focus on fostering innovation spaces where Gen Beta can contribute their creative ideas. This could involve platforms for brainstorming, opportunities to participate in product development, or rewards for innovative ideas. For anyone who still sees Gen Z or Gen Alpha as the most noteworthy groups of this era, it’s time to rethink—Gen Beta is emerging and will surpass them in influence by leaps and bounds. The world they are growing up in isn’t just equipped with advanced tools; it’s a world they are designing themselves, from the economy to culture. This is an era where human creativity and limitless potential will be harnessed to drive real change. Generation Beta is not merely the \"future\"; they are the force that will push us beyond the boundaries of imagination.",

In their world, there is no boundary between reality and imagination, no framework for \"impossible\" or \"too difficult.\" Everything is an opportunity, and every limitation is a canvas for their creativity. They are the new generation who not only push beyond limits but redefine what \"limits\" mean altogether.\nLet's dive into the world of Gen Beta. Who are they? How are they different from previous generations? And why should you start understanding them today? Because this generation isn’t just stepping into the future—they are the ones creating it!",
        "what_is_gen_beta?_who_are_they?": "**Gen Beta refers to individuals born from 2025 onwards.** They are the first generation to grow up in a truly digital world, living in an era where technology is seamlessly integrated into daily life. Unlike previous generations who had to adapt to technological changes, Generation Beta will naturally coexist with technology as if it were second nature.\nWhat sets Gen Beta apart is their unique bond with technology—it will be as intrinsic to them as...",
        "advanced_creativity": "Gen Beta possesses boundless creativity, seamlessly blending technology with innovation in extraordinary ways. Their problem-solving methods go far beyond traditional approaches, embracing out-of-the-box thinking that previous generations might not have imagined.",
        "expertise_in_technology": "For Generation Beta, technology isn’t just a tool—it’s their primary language for engaging with the world. They have an innate understanding of advanced technologies such as [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/futurist/thai-ai-service-platforms), data analytics, and cutting-edge innovations, often requiring minimal effort to learn and adapt.",
        "data-driven_decision-making": "While Gen X and Gen Y tend to rely on personal experiences and advice from elders, and Gen Z draws insights from social media and online opinions, Gen Beta takes it a step further. They base their decisions primarily on data and analytics. With exceptional skills in processing complex information, they can quickly grasp the big picture and make informed choices.",
        "emphasis_on_ethics_and_sustainability": "Gen Beta places significant value on sustainability and ethics. They are deeply committed to driving positive change in society and the environment, striving for tangible improvements that reflect their values.",

It should go beyond simply providing information to challenge traditional mindsets and encourage critical thinking. This generation values intellectual depth, diverse perspectives, and systematic connections between ideas.\nTo build credibility, marketers should rely on insights from research and ensure transparency in data sources. Gen Beta prefers to verify and analyze information themselves, making transparency a crucial factor in gaining their trust.",
        "use_technology_to_foster_connection": "To align with Generation Beta marketing solutions, businesses must innovate their communication strategies to provide seamless, personalized experiences. This includes leveraging platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or real-time customer interaction systems capable of understanding both context and emotions for smoother and more meaningful connections.",
        "highlight_transparency_and_sustainability_across_b": "As socially conscious individuals, Gen Beta demands tangible evidence of efforts to create a positive impact. Examples include detailed disclosures of production processes, demonstrations of social and environmental contributions, and clear sustainability metrics. These efforts significantly enhance trust and loyalty among this generation.",
        "foster_a_sense_of_participation": "For Generation Beta, engagement goes beyond listening—it’s about co-creating products and services with brands. Businesses should focus on fostering innovation spaces where Gen Beta can contribute their creative ideas. This could involve platforms for brainstorming, opportunities to participate in product development, or rewards for innovative ideas.\nFor anyone who still sees Gen Z or Gen Alpha as the most noteworthy groups of this era, it’s time to rethink—Gen Beta is emerging and will surpass them in influence by leaps and bounds. The world they are growing up in isn’t just equipped with advanced tools; it’s a world they are designing themselves, from the economy to culture.\nThis is an era where human creativity and limitless potential will be harnessed to drive real change. Generation Beta is not merely the \"future\"; they are the force that will push us beyond the boundaries of imagination."

Instead, the immersive experience—a deeply emotional and interactive journey—has become the centerpiece of modern event design. Audiences now want to *feel* a brand’s presence, not just view it. ## What Is Immersive Experience? An immersive experience crafts an event environment that makes attendees feel like they’re entering a different world. This is achieved through a strategic blend of immersive technology, sensory engagement, and powerful storytelling. It stimulates emotions and all five senses to deliver long-lasting brand impressions. Strategically, immersive experience design goes beyond dazzling visuals. It deepens customer relationships, drives sales opportunities, and communicates brand values in compelling, memorable ways. ## Popular Immersive Technologies for Event Design To deliver a successful immersive experience, organizations combine innovative technology with creativity and strategic planning. Leading technologies include: ### VR (Virtual Reality) Creates a fully simulated environment allowing participants to be \"inside\" a scenario. Ideal for product demos, simulations, and complex storytelling. ### AR/XR (Augmented/Extended Reality) Overlays digital graphics onto the physical world, making events more interactive and realistic—such as scanning an image to reveal a 3D model. ### Projection Mapping Projects visuals or videos onto real-world surfaces like walls or stages, transforming ordinary spaces into extraordinary visual experiences. ### Spatial Audio & Scent Design Incorporates directional sound and scent to enhance immersion, allowing emotional connection with the environment. ## Why Are Immersive Event Trends Booming in 2025? - **Consumers Value Experiences Over Products**: Especially among [Gen Z and Millennials]( preference has shifted toward meaningful experiences rather than physical ownership. - **Brands Need to Stand Out**: In a saturated market, unique experiences leave lasting impressions. - **Tech Is More Accessible Than Ever**: Advancements have lowered costs, enabling small and mid-sized businesses to implement immersive tech. ## Key Elements of a Successful Immersive Experience 1. **Concept Driven**: Every experience starts with a clear concept. Technology must serve brand goals—storytelling, product promotion, or conveying values. **Multi-sensory**: Stimulate multiple senses—sight, sound, smell, and even taste. **Real-Time Interaction**: Instant engagement like mobile voting or avatar building boosts brand recall more than passive participation. **Data Integration**: Linking audience data with [CRM software]( or marketing automation gathers behavioral insights to improve future campaigns. ## Case Study: Jenosize Powers “Offline to Online Expo” with Immersive Design The “Offline to Online Expo,” organized by the Department of Business Development (DBD), Ministry of Commerce, and managed by Jenosize, toured five regions across Thailand covering over 2,000 square meters per location. With 9+ months of planning, it aimed to benefit public agencies, entrepreneurs, and attendees.

      "content": "# What Is Low-Code/No-Code? Build Apps Without Writing Code! In today’s digital age, the ability to rapidly develop applications and digital solutions is crucial for organizational competitiveness. Low code and no code platforms are effective technologies gaining popularity worldwide, helping SMEs, retail businesses, and government agencies improve services. ## What Is Low Code? Low code platforms enable users to develop applications or business systems with minimal or no coding. Users design workflows, databases, and user interfaces using intuitive drag-and-drop tools. Low code balances ease of use with customization, allowing developers to extend applications as needed. It suits organizations needing flexibility with some developer resources. ## What Is a No Code Platform? No code platforms allow users to build applications without writing any code. Designed for non-technical staff like marketing or operations teams, they use pre-built templates and ready-to-use features. No code reduces IT workload and promotes citizen developers, enabling employees outside IT to participate in digital transformation. ## Business and Organizational Benefits of Low Code and No Code Platforms - **Reduced development time and cost:** Cuts the need for full development teams and minimizes coding and testing time. - **Accelerates digital transformation:** Facilitates smooth transitions to digital systems, especially for organizations with limited tech infrastructure. - **Enhances operational agility:** Enables frequent iteration, testing, and improvements without complex development cycles. - **Alleviates IT workload:** Allows IT teams to focus on complex systems while other departments manage simpler applications. - **Ideal for resource-constrained organizations:** Beneficial for SMEs needing tailored systems without heavy IT investment. ## Real-World Use Cases in Business and Government ### Retail Businesses Low code/no code platforms help build stock management systems with real-time inventory updates, low stock alerts, and automated promotional campaigns. They enable personalized marketing by analyzing customer data without large development teams. ### SMEs Small businesses can create web applications like online order systems, sales dashboards, or basic CRM tools quickly and adjust them as they grow. ### Government Agencies Government agencies use these platforms for online request forms, feedback systems, and project tracking dashboards, improving public services without requiring coding expertise. ## Cautions When Using Low Code and No Code Platforms - **Security and compliance limitations:** Not all platforms meet enterprise security or industry regulations. - **Vendor lock-in:** Dependence on a single provider can complicate migration or scaling. - **Quality control:** Non-technical development may cause UX/UI flaws or poor data structure. Low code and no code platforms transform application development by enabling innovation across departments, delivering faster, cost-effective, and adaptive solutions. When used strategically, they offer competitive advantages through flexibility, differentiation, and sustainable growth. If your organization seeks a [digital transformation service]( with scalable, future-proof technology, these platforms are worth considering.",

Low code and no code platforms are gaining popularity worldwide, helping SMEs, retail businesses, and government agencies improve services efficiently. ## What Is Low Code? Low code platforms enable users to develop applications with minimal or no coding, using drag-and-drop tools for workflows, databases, and user interfaces. They balance ease of use with customization, allowing developers to extend applications as needed. This suits organizations needing flexibility with some developer resources. ## What Is a No Code Platform? No code platforms allow users to build applications without writing any code. Designed for non-technical staff like marketing or operations teams, they use pre-built templates and ready-to-use features. This reduces IT workload and promotes citizen developers, enabling broader participation in digital transformation. ## Business and Organizational Benefits of Low Code and No Code Platforms - **Reduced development time and cost:** Cuts the need for full development teams and minimizes coding and testing. - **Accelerates digital transformation:** Helps organizations with limited tech infrastructure transition smoothly. - **Enhances operational agility:** Supports frequent iteration and improvements without complex cycles. - **Alleviates IT workload:** Lets IT focus on complex systems while other departments manage simpler apps. - **Ideal for resource-constrained organizations:** Especially beneficial for SMEs needing tailored systems without heavy IT investment. ## Real-World Use Cases in Business and Government ### Retail Businesses Low code/no code platforms help build stock management systems with real-time inventory updates, low stock alerts, and automated promotions. They enable personalized marketing by analyzing customer data without large development teams. ### SMEs Small businesses can create web applications like online order systems, sales dashboards, or CRM tools quickly and adjust them as they grow. ### Government Agencies These platforms improve public services through online request forms, feedback systems, and project tracking dashboards, managed by non-technical staff and enhancing transparency. ## Cautions When Using Low Code and No Code Platforms - **Security and compliance limitations:** Not all platforms meet enterprise security or industry regulations. - **Vendor lock-in:** Dependence on one provider can complicate future migration or scaling. - **Quality control:** Non-technical development may cause UX/UI issues or poor data structure. Low code and no code platforms transform application development, enabling innovation across departments with faster, cost-effective, and adaptive solutions. When used strategically, they offer competitive advantages through flexibility, differentiation, and sustainable growth. If your organization seeks a [digital transformation service]( with scalable, future-proof technology, these platforms are worth considering.",

      "content": "# 10 Risk Factors Businesses Must Manage in 2025 and Beyond As time goes on, our world is facing increasingly complex crises, with various issues becoming more interconnected than ever. From geopolitical tensions and climate change to economic uncertainty and rapid technological advancements, today’s global vulnerabilities stem from these intertwined risk factors, creating cascading effects that are impossible to separate. According to the **Global Risks Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum (WEF)**, several risk factors demand urgent attention. This has prompted policymakers and organizations worldwide to take immediate action in preparing for potential threats across multiple dimensions. One effective approach involves leveraging in-depth data analysis and expert insights from [digital consulting]( to develop strategic, proactive risk management solutions. ## 10 Global Risk Factors in 2025 That Organizations Must Prepare For ### Economic Risks #### 1. Geopolitical Conflicts and Tensions Political conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties are major risk factors affecting the global economy. Tensions between major powers such as the United States, China, and Russia could lead to economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and disruptions in global supply chains. Conflicts in the Middle East and Asia may impact energy prices and financial market stability. Organizations relying on international markets must diversify resources and business partners while monitoring trade policies and protectionist measures. Economic Crises and Financial Instability The global economy remains fragile despite recovery from COVID-19. Economic slowdowns in major markets like the U. and Europe, rising interest rates, and high public debt create financial uncertainties. Businesses should track economic indicators and develop strategies like investment diversification and cash flow management. Health Crises and Pandemics The risk of new disease outbreaks remains significant due to virus mutations, vaccine hesitancy, and healthcare limitations. Businesses should adopt flexible work arrangements and enhance workplace health and safety measures. Labor Shortages and Economic Inequality Declining birth rates and workforce shifts cause labor shortages. Automation and AI replace some jobs, risking unemployment for low-skilled workers. Organizations must invest in upskilling and promote economic equality. Shortages of Strategic Resources Supply shortages of semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and clean energy resources arise from geopolitical and environmental factors. Businesses should explore alternative sources, recycling technologies, and boost domestic production. ### Environmental & Social Risks #### 6. Environmental Disasters and Climate Change Natural disasters like floods, storms, and heatwaves increasingly disrupt industries, raising operational costs and damaging infrastructure. Climate change drives regulatory shifts toward cleaner energy and carbon reduction. Businesses must adopt sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and optimize resource efficiency. ESG compliance is becoming critical for long-term success. Erosion of Human Rights and Civil Liberties Increasing control over information, media restrictions, and tightened civil freedoms pose risks to businesses. Policies limiting information access and strict data regulations affect transparency and trade. Human rights concerns such as forced labor and privacy violations can damage reputations and cause legal issues. Companies must enforce human rights policies, conduct supply chain due diligence, and ensure ethical compliance. ### Technological Risks #### 8. Social Divisions and Misinformation Misinformation and fake news impact society and business, especially via social media. False information harms brand reputation and sparks social conflicts. Businesses should implement data governance, use AI and machine learning to detect false information, and enhance communication transparency. Technology and Cyber Threats Advancements in AI, [Blockchain]( and [Quantum Computing]( offer opportunities but increase cybersecurity risks such as ransomware attacks.",

According to the **Global Risks Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum (WEF)**, several risk factors demand urgent attention. This has prompted policymakers and organizations worldwide to take immediate action in preparing for potential threats across multiple dimensions. One effective approach involves leveraging in-depth data analysis and expert insights from [digital consulting]( to develop strategic, proactive risk management solutions. ## 10 Global Risk Factors in 2025 That Organizations Must Prepare For ### Economic Risks #### 1. Geopolitical Conflicts and Tensions Political conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties are major risk factors affecting the global economy. Tensions between major powers such as the United States, China, and Russia could lead to economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and disruptions in global supply chains. Conflicts in the Middle East and Asia may impact energy prices and financial market stability. Organizations relying on international markets must diversify resources and business partners while monitoring trade policies and protectionist measures. Economic Crises and Financial Instability Despite recovery from COVID-19 impacts, the global economy remains fragile. Economic slowdowns in major markets like the U. and Europe could affect industries widely. Rising interest rates and high public debt create financial uncertainties. Businesses should track economic indicators and develop strategies such as investment diversification and cash flow management. Health Crises and Pandemics The risk of new disease outbreaks remains significant due to virus mutations, vaccine hesitancy, and healthcare limitations. Businesses dependent on stable workforces and supply chains should adopt flexible work arrangements and enhance health and safety measures. Labor Shortages and Economic Inequality Declining birth rates and workforce shifts cause labor shortages. Automation and AI replace some jobs, risking unemployment for low-skilled workers. Organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling while promoting economic equality and access to opportunities. Shortages of Strategic Resources Supply shortages of semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and clean energy resources arise from geopolitical and environmental factors. Trade uncertainties and conflicts may disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Businesses should explore alternative sources, develop recycling technologies, and boost domestic production to reduce import reliance. ### Environmental & Social Risks #### 6. Environmental Disasters and Climate Change Natural disasters like floods, storms, and heatwaves increasingly impact industries through higher costs, supply chain disruptions, and infrastructure damage. Climate change drives regulatory shifts pushing cleaner energy adoption and carbon reduction. Businesses must integrate sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and optimize resource efficiency. ESG compliance pressures from governments, investors, and consumers are reshaping corporate priorities. Erosion of Human Rights and Civil Liberties Increasing control over information, media restrictions, and tightened civil freedoms pose risks to businesses. Policies limiting information access, strict data regulations, and freedom of expression restrictions affect transparency and trade. Human rights concerns such as forced labor, surveillance, and privacy violations can damage reputation and cause legal issues. Companies must enforce human rights policies, conduct supply chain due diligence, and ensure ethical compliance to maintain stability and trust. ### Technological Risks #### 8. Social Divisions and Misinformation Misinformation and fake news impact society and business, especially via social media. False information harms brand reputation and sparks social conflicts.

From geopolitical tensions and climate change to economic uncertainty and rapid technological advancements, today’s global vulnerabilities stem from these intertwined risk factors, creating cascading effects that are impossible to separate.\n\nAccording to the **Global Risks Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum (WEF)**, several risk factors demand urgent attention. This has prompted policymakers and organizations worldwide to take immediate action in preparing for potential threats across multiple dimensions. One effective approach involves leveraging in-depth data analysis and expert insights from [digital consulting](https://www.jenosize.com/en/service/consulting) to develop strategic, proactive risk management solutions.\n\n## 10 Global Risk Factors in 2025 That Organizations Must Prepare For\n\n### Economic Risks\n\n#### 1. Geopolitical Conflicts and Tensions\nPolitical conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties are major risk factors affecting the global economy. Tensions between major powers such as the United States, China, and Russia could lead to economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and disruptions in global supply chains. Conflicts in the Middle East and Asia may impact energy prices and financial market stability.\n\nOrganizations relying on international markets must diversify resources and business partners while monitoring trade policies and protectionist measures.\n\n#### 2. Economic Crises and Financial Instability\nDespite recovery from COVID-19 impacts, the global economy remains fragile. Economic slowdowns in major markets like the U.S. and Europe could affect industries widely. Rising interest rates and high public debt create financial uncertainties.\n\nBusinesses should track economic indicators and develop strategies such as investment diversification and cash flow management.\n\n#### 3. Health Crises and Pandemics\nThe risk of new disease outbreaks remains significant due to virus mutations, vaccine hesitancy, and healthcare limitations. Businesses dependent on stable workforces and supply chains should adopt flexible work arrangements and enhance health and safety measures.\n\n#### 4. Labor Shortages and Economic Inequality\nDeclining birth rates and workforce shifts cause labor shortages. Automation and AI replace some jobs, risking unemployment for low-skilled workers.\n\nOrganizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling while promoting economic equality and access to opportunities.\n\n#### 5. Shortages of Strategic Resources\nSupply shortages of semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and clean energy resources arise from geopolitical and environmental factors. Trade uncertainties and conflicts may disrupt supply chains and increase costs.\n\nBusinesses should explore alternative sources, develop recycling technologies, and boost domestic production to reduce import reliance.\n\n### Environmental & Social Risks\n\n#### 6. Environmental Disasters and Climate Change\nNatural disasters like floods, storms, and heatwaves increasingly impact industries through higher costs, supply chain disruptions, and infrastructure damage.\n\nClimate change drives regulatory shifts pushing cleaner energy adoption and carbon reduction. Businesses must integrate sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and optimize resource efficiency. ESG compliance pressures from governments, investors, and consumers are reshaping corporate priorities.\n\n#### 7. Erosion of Human Rights and Civil Liberties\nIncreasing control over information, media restrictions, and tightened civil freedoms pose risks to businesses. Policies limiting information access, strict data regulations, and freedom of expression restrictions affect transparency and trade.\n\nHuman rights concerns such as forced labor, surveillance, and privacy violations can damage reputation and cause legal issues.\n\nCompanies must enforce human rights policies, conduct supply chain due diligence, and ensure ethical compliance to maintain stability and trust.\n\n### Technological Risks\n\n#### 8. Social Divisions and Misinformation\nMisinformation and fake news impact society and business, especially via social media. False information harms brand reputation and sparks social conflicts.\n\nBusinesses should implement data governance, use AI and machine learning to detect false information, and enhance communication transparency.\n\n#### 9. Technology and Cyber Threats\nAdvancements in AI, [Blockchain](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/transformation-and-technology/what-is-blockchain), and [Quantum Computing](https://www.jenosize.com/en/ideas/futurist/what-is-quantum-computing) offer opportunities but increase cybersecurity risks such as ransomware attacks.\n\n> [Content truncated for brevity]\n",

The more an event impresses attendees to the point they \"don’t want to leave,\" the clearer the sign of a quality brand experience. This success results from intentional planning and meticulous attention to every detail, anchored in a **sensory experience**. Leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates. ## What Is a Sensory Experience? A sensory experience is a marketing approach that engages the human senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions. By appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments fostering deep emotional engagement and personal connection. Brands mastering sensory experiences embed themselves in memory, fueling long-term loyalty and organic word of mouth. ## 7 Sensory Experience Techniques for Designing Unforgettable Event Experiences ### 1. Stimulate Sight *\"Attract from the first glance with a design that reflects your brand identity. \"* Visual presentation is the gateway to your brand’s universe. Use spatial design, lighting, brand colors, logos, and stage visuals that reflect your brand image. Brand-consistent color palettes, mood-complementing lighting, and Instagram-worthy photo spots boost online sharing and visibility. Engage Taste *\"A great taste lingers longer than any words. \"* Food and beverages are storytelling tools. Curate menus aligned with your event’s theme, incorporate local flavors, or develop signature drinks and treats reflecting your brand identity. Each bite extends your brand narrative. Evoke Memory Through Smell *\"Scent is the most powerful trigger of memory. \"* Scents influence mood and memory. Pleasant aromas can induce calmness, luxury, or energy. Align fragrances with the event theme, e. , lavender for wellness or citrus for energizing environments. Enliven the Atmosphere with Sound *\"The right sound sets the right mood. \"* Sound shapes the event experience. Choose music fitting the theme, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound design for product reveals. Every sound element contributes to the sensory experience. Activate Touch *\"Tactile experiences create lasting impressions. \"* Touch adds a tangible dimension. Use textured materials in decor, offer hands-on product demos, or provide custom giveaways. DIY or workshop zones encourage physical and emotional engagement. Tap into Emotion *\"When the heart feels, the brand stays. \"* Emotional engagement transforms experiences. Encourage sharing personal stories, use inspiring content, or tell your brand’s story through short films. Emotionally charged moments convert guests into brand advocates. Add Meaning Through Spirit *\"Brands with purpose make a deeper impact. \"* True impact reflects the brand’s deeper values and mission. Include social impact initiatives, tie into environmental or cultural causes, or create space for guests to share dreams and beliefs. Make every moment meaningful beyond just “fun. ” ## Case Study: Brands That Successfully Used Sensory Experience to Win Over Audiences Incorporating sensory experience in event planning creates lasting impressions, shifts consumer behavior, boosts conversions, and builds brand recognition. ### Traveloka: Engaging Travelers with Limited Space Post-COVID-19, Traveloka reignited traveler interest with a 30-square-meter booth in a busy Bangkok mall.

The more an event impresses attendees to the point they \"don’t want to leave,\" the clearer the signal that the brand has delivered a quality experience. This success results from intentional planning, design, and meticulous attention to every detail—anchored in what’s known as a **sensory experience**. Leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates. ## What Is a Sensory Experience? A sensory experience is a marketing approach that engages the human senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions. By appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments fostering deep emotional engagement and personal connection. Brands mastering sensory experiences embed themselves in memory, fueling long-term loyalty and organic word of mouth. ## 7 Sensory Experience Techniques for Designing Unforgettable Event Experiences ### 1. Stimulate Sight *\"Attract from the first glance with a design that reflects your brand identity. \"* Visual presentation is the gateway to your brand’s universe. Use spatial design, lighting, brand colors, logos, and stage visuals that reflect your brand image. Brand-consistent color palettes, mood-complementing lighting, and Instagram-worthy photo spots boost online sharing and visibility. Engage Taste *\"A great taste lingers longer than any words. \"* Food and beverages are storytelling tools. Curate menus aligned with your event’s theme, incorporate local flavors, or develop signature drinks and treats reflecting your brand identity. Each bite extends your brand narrative. Evoke Memory Through Smell *\"Scent is the most powerful trigger of memory. \"* Scents influence mood and memory. Pleasant aromas can induce calmness, luxury, or energy. Align fragrance strategy with the event theme, e. , lavender for wellness or citrus for energizing environments. Enliven the Atmosphere with Sound *\"The right sound sets the right mood. \"* Sound shapes the event experience. Choose music fitting the theme, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound design for product reveals. Every sound element contributes to the sensory experience. Activate Touch *\"Tactile experiences create lasting impressions. \"* Touch adds a tangible dimension. Use textured materials in decor, offer hands-on demos, or provide custom giveaways. DIY or workshop zones encourage physical and emotional engagement. Tap into Emotion *\"When the heart feels, the brand stays. \"* Emotional engagement transforms experiences. Encourage sharing personal stories, use inspiring content, or tell your brand’s story through short films. Emotionally charged moments convert guests into brand advocates. Add Meaning Through Spirit *\"Brands with purpose make a deeper impact. \"* True impact comes when experiences reflect deeper brand values and mission. Include social impact initiatives, tie into environmental or cultural causes, or create space for guests to share dreams and beliefs. Make every moment meaningful. ## Case Study: Brands That Successfully Used Sensory Experience to Win Over Audiences Incorporating sensory experience in event planning creates lasting impressions, shifts consumer behavior, boosts conversions, and builds brand recognition. ### Traveloka: Engaging Travelers with Limited Space Post-COVID-19, Traveloka reignited traveler interest with a 30-square-meter booth in a Bangkok mall.

Successful events impress attendees so much that they \"don’t want to leave,\" signaling a quality brand experience.\nThis success results from intentional planning and meticulous attention to every detail, anchored in a **sensory experience**. Leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates.",
        "what_is_a_sensory_experience?": "**A sensory experience is a marketing approach that engages the human senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions.** By appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments fostering deep emotional engagement and personal connection.\nBrands mastering sensory experiences embed themselves in memory, fueling long-term loyalty and organic word of mouth.",

Choose theme-fitting music, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound designs for product reveals. Every sound element should enhance the sensory experience.",

Effective time management helps focus on high-value tasks and achieve better outcomes. Discover 6 proven techniques to increase work efficiency and transform your productivity. ## 6 Time Management Techniques to Increase Work Efficiency ### 1. Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritizing Tasks Effectively Developed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, this method categorizes tasks by urgency and importance: - **Important and Urgent (Q1):** Critical tasks needing immediate attention (emergencies, deadlines). - **Important but Not Urgent (Q2):** Strategic planning, long-term projects, personal development. - **Not Important but Urgent (Q3):** Meetings, requests, tasks to delegate. - **Not Important and Not Urgent (Q4):** Time-wasting activities like excessive social media. Focus on Q2 tasks for long-term value, delegate Q3, and minimize Q4. The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle): Focus on High-Impact Tasks 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. To apply: - Identify tasks with the highest impact. - Prioritize and allocate time to these tasks. - Reduce or eliminate low-value tasks. The 1-3-5 Method: Structuring Daily Priorities Balance workload by focusing daily on: - 1 major task (high priority, time-consuming) - 3 medium tasks (important but less demanding) - 5 small tasks (quick, necessary) Plan weekly for better clarity and focus. Eat Your Frog: Tackling the Toughest Task First Inspired by Brian Tracy and Mark Twain, complete your hardest task first thing in the morning. Your \"frog\" is the most difficult, tedious, important, or often procrastinated task. This helps ease the rest of the day. Deep Work: Maximizing Productivity with Focused Sessions Cal Newport’s concept emphasizes distraction-free work for strategic planning and creativity. To implement: - Set 1-2 hour blocks for deep work. - Eliminate distractions (turn off notifications, phones, emails). - Choose a conducive environment. - Define clear goals per session. Research shows multitasking can reduce efficiency by up to 80%. Establish \"no-interruption zones\" to boost productivity. The Pomodoro Technique: Working in Time Blocks Developed by Francesco Cirillo, this technique breaks work into short intervals to enhance focus and reduce fatigue. - Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. - After four cycles, take a longer break. This structured approach helps maintain concentration and energy. > Effective time management is essential for professionals to prioritize tasks, reduce stress, and drive business success.",

Effective time management helps focus on high-value tasks and achieve better outcomes. Discover 6 proven techniques to increase work efficiency and transform your productivity. ## 6 Time Management Techniques to Increase Work Efficiency ### 1. Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritizing Tasks Effectively Developed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, this method categorizes tasks by urgency and importance: - **Important and Urgent (Q1):** Critical tasks needing immediate attention (emergencies, deadlines). - **Important but Not Urgent (Q2):** Strategic planning, long-term projects, personal development. - **Not Important but Urgent (Q3):** Meetings, requests, tasks to delegate. - **Not Important and Not Urgent (Q4):** Time-wasting activities like excessive social media. Focus on Q2 tasks for long-term value, delegate Q3, and minimize Q4. The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle): Focus on High-Impact Tasks 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. To apply: - Identify tasks with the highest impact. - Prioritize and allocate time to these tasks. - Reduce or eliminate low-value tasks. The 1-3-5 Method: Structuring Daily Priorities Balance workload by focusing daily on: - 1 major task (high priority, time-consuming) - 3 medium tasks (important but less demanding) - 5 small tasks (quick, necessary) Plan weekly for better clarity and focus. Eat Your Frog: Tackling the Toughest Task First Inspired by Brian Tracy and Mark Twain, complete your hardest task first thing in the morning. Your \"frog\" is the task that is: - Most difficult - Most tedious - Most important - Often procrastinated This helps entrepreneurs handle critical decisions and complex problems effectively. Deep Work: Maximizing Productivity with Focused Sessions Cal Newport’s concept emphasizes distraction-free work for strategic planning and innovation. To implement: - Set 1-2 hour blocks for deep work. - Eliminate distractions (turn off notifications, phones, emails). - Choose a conducive environment. - Define clear goals for each session. Research shows multitasking can reduce efficiency by up to 80%. Establish \"no-interruption zones\" to boost productivity. The Pomodoro Technique: Working in Time Blocks Developed by Francesco Cirillo, this technique breaks work into short intervals to enhance focus and reduce fatigue. Typically, work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break, repeating cycles to maintain concentration.",
